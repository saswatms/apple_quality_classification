This is ML (Supervised Learning) Classification code.

The dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality).

Here I've created 2 files

1. 01Apple_Classification.ipynb
2. 02Apple_Classification.ipynb

The first file is which I've created and the second file is for reference only, It's not my work.

In file 1 by apply algorithm without processing to much data. I got prety good accuracy and ROC value. because the data is already good and was not skewed.

**It's recommended to do preprocessing**.

Thankyou.
